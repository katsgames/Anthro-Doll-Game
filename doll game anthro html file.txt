		<!-- this is where I do an intro into the website -->
		<p> Hello and welcome to Kat's Games. This is where I plan to code and work on various games. There is only a WIP up (or coming up very soon) but I hope you enjoy looking around my site. 
		</p>
		<p> The first project I will be working on is an anthro doll game. I've been frustrated by the lack of good anthro doll games on the internet, so I figured I'd try my hand at my own. So far I've drawn up two body types, which I believe will allow the player to create a larger variety of characters. The clothes are semi-modern, with some inspired by fantasy.
